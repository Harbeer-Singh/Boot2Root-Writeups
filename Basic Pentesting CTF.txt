                                                                                                      This is a walkthrough of how how solved the Baisc Pentesting CTF on TryHackMe 

1. Connect With the TryHackMe server using Command  $ sudo openvpn Downloads/Ynos.ovpn
2. Confirm You can Connect to the Machine using the command $ ping (Ip of the machine)
3. start the nmap scan with $ nmap -sV -O -T5 -p- 10.10.87.116 -oN Nmap.results
4. While scanning this start dirbusting the website and you will find some directories here mainely development (nothing important)
5. the nmap results will show that the SMB sercive is open one port 139,445 , this is a very buggy and exploitable serivice and we will exploit this to gain access of this computer
6. as the SMB service is open we will attack it with the tool enum4linux with the command $enum4linux  10.10.87.116  | tee enum4linux.results
7. From this result we find out that the username of this person is jan and previously from our enumeration we found that this person had weak password so we will do a bruteforce attack with hydra with the command $hydra -l jan -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -f ssh://10.10.87.116 -o hydra.results
8. from hydra we found out the password for this user 
9. now we will gain access to its shell using the command $ssh jan@10.10.87.116
10. after gaining accesss start enumeration with basic commands like id and sysinfo 
11. here i got to know that there is a file that contains a key to your machine that you can give to someone and then they can log in the comp as you 
12. here jan had the file in .ssh folder named as id_rsa
13. now we need to convert the private key into hash format that can be cracked by john the ripper
14. we do that by $ ssh2john id_rsa>hash hash is the filename of this new hash 
15. now we crack this hash by  $ john hash --wordlists=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
16. the code will be beeswax 
17. now if we try to get the shell it will say that file permission too open so we would have to change file permission to 600 by command $chmod 600 id_rsa
18. now we will gain access to the shell using the command $ssh -i id_rsa kay@10.10.87.116
19. enter pass beeswax
20. get the pass through this user kay
