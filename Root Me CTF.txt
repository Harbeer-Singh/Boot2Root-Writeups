                                                                                                   This is a walkthrough of how how solved the RootMe CTF on TryHackMe 

1. Connect With the TryHackMe server using Command  $ sudo openvpn Downloads/Ynos.ovpn
2. Confirm You can Connect to the Machine using the command $ ping (Ip of the machine)
3. Start the nmap scan with $ nmap -sV -O -T5 -p- 10.10.109.68 -oN Nmap.results
4. While scanning this start dirbusting the website and you will find some directories
5. Nmap shows the 2 ports are open , the ssh and apache service 
6. Dirbuster shows that inside the css dir we have panel file that can be used to upload files 
7. As we know the apache server is writtern in php we will upload a php reverse shell file from pentest monkey 
8. we get to know that uploading php files are not allowed here so we will change the extension to php5 and them upload again 
9. type nc -nvlp 4444 in you terminal to hear from the website and refresh it 
10. you will gain the shell of this machine 
11. next step is to find the user.txt flag and the then try user escalation with the by first finding suid bit with the command $-perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null
12. We find out that we can use the python file(/usr/bin/python) to gain access to this system 
13. so we go to gtfobins and find out the exploit command $python -c 'import os; os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-p")'
14. As soon as we type thiswe gain the admin shell to this pc and then we have to find the root flag that  is in the file root.txt
