                                                                                          This is a walkthrough of how how solved the 0day CTF on TryHackMe 

1. Connect With the TryHackMe server using Command  $ sudo openvpn Downloads/Ynos.ovpn
2. Confirm You can Connect to the Machine using the command $ ping (Ip of the machine)
3. Start the nmap scan with $ nmap -sV -O -T5 -p- 10.10. -oN Nmap.results
4. Nmap results show that the apache server and ssh are open on this device 
5. and no directories on this machine 
6. so now we use Nikto with the command $nikto -h 10.10.125.30 
7. nikto finds that the site appears to be vulnerable to the 'shellshock' vulnerability  [CVE-2014-6271 and CVE-2014-7169]
8. the best way to exploit this vulnerability is via Metaspliot , so we will use metaspliot via $msfconsole
9. we will type $search shellshock in the msf console and it will show that it is exploitable and has a excellent exploit so we will attack it and we gain access to the terminal and user flag
10. then with enumeration we find out that the kernel version of the termial is too old and subsequently search for ite exploits by searching $Linux ubuntu 3.13.0-32-generic exploit 
11. we found an exploit on exploitDB , we download the exploit which in in C language and upload it onto the machine using meterpreter,then we compile and run this file on the target computer 
12. when we run this file we get admin access to this pc and we find the root flag in the root folder
